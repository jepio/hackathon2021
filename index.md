## Welcome to Hackathon 2021

I attempted to deploy [Container Linux Config Transpiler](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/container-linux-config-transpiler) as a serverless app to [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview).

### Try it

{% include index.html %}

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jepio/hackathon2021/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
